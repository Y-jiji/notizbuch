== About Imagination

During mathematical or algorithmic thinking, visualization is often involved. While most psychologists may draw a spectrum between "realistic" and "abstract", there are two types of visualization in the "abstract" end. One is loose and free, and the other is rigorious and formal. 

Currently, I think I've lost some balance between these two types of visualization. When I work on algorithmic problems, most of the time I may visualize things well, but missing boundary cases and sometimes it results in runtime error code. Therefore, figuring out how to practice the second kind of visualization might be the task for the next a few months.
