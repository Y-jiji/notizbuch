= Motivation & Imporvision

#summary[
    #tag[motiv:intro] Write down stuff about what a motivation is. 
    #task[Write down stuff of mental movements]
    #tag[motiv:emo] Fairly speaking, emotionally/narratively inspired motivation can generate very very good music, because music is meant to convey these stuff. But on the other hand, mapping these content to music is a very hard skill, since the urge of writing these stuff down is very scarce in real life.

== Emotional & Narrative

=== Trapped

#tag[motiv:trapped] Speaking of being trapped, there are two kinds of plots afterwards: breaking out, or trapped forever. I personally prefer the first one. The other flexible elements are how we get out of the trap or if the main character is even trying to break out, how the emotion changes. 

#tag[motiv:trapped:momentum] This element is a common struggle of modern people. We don't strive for something because we are afraid of failure, especially the failure after we really grinded for it and the quality of life may drop forever. This often happens to those who are considered talented at a very young age but later hindered by the impression that everything can be done easily and not dilligent enough to wait for things to finally pay off.
